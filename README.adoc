image::images/screenshot.png[CulinaryQuery Screenshot, title="CulinaryQuery Screenshot"]

== Introduction

The CulinaryQuery project aims to seamlessly integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into a Django application, enabling automated question generation for menu items based on their descriptions. This repository provides the necessary components and documentation to achieve this integration, including setting up scheduled tasks, building API endpoints, and storing generated questions in a database.

The API endpoints will serve multiple purposes: 

- On-Demand Question Generation: Users can request the API to generate questions for specific menu items. ChatGPT utilizes menu item descriptions to create questions, which are then stored in the database.
- Fetching Pre-Generated Questions: An API endpoint enables users to retrieve pre-generated questions from the database for a given menu item. This feature is particularly useful when questions have already been generated and stored.
- Generating Questions from Text: Users can input any text, and the API will generate a relevant question based on that text. This functionality extends the application's use beyond menu item descriptions.

== Project Components

=== Django Framework

The project is developed using the Django web framework, a powerful tool for building web applications. The application's architecture is based on Django's Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, allowing for organized data modeling, logic implementation, and user interface design.

=== OpenAI's ChatGPT

The core engine behind question generation is OpenAI's ChatGPT model. This model employs natural language processing to create meaningful and contextually relevant questions based on menu item descriptions.

=== Scheduled Task: Daily Question Generation

A scheduled task, configured using cron jobs, automates the process of generating questions for menu items. This ensures that the question database remains up-to-date with relevant and current questions.

=== API Endpoints

== API Endpoints

|===
| Endpoint Name | Purpose | Methods Allowed

| `/api/menuitems/`
| Retrieve a list of all menu items or create a new menu item.
| GET, POST

| `/api/menuitems/{pk}/`
| Retrieve, update, or delete a specific menu item.
| GET, PUT, DELETE

| `/api/questions/generate/`
| Generate questions for specified menu items based on their descriptions.
| POST

| `/api/questions/pre-generated/{pk}/`
| Fetch pre-generated questions for a specific menu item.
| GET

| `/api/questions/generate-from-text/`
| Generate a question based on provided text.
| POST
|===

NOTE: Replace `{pk}` with the actual primary key of the menu item.


The Django application exposes several API endpoints, catering to different use cases:

- Generating Questions for Menu Items
  Users can request the API to generate questions for specific menu items. ChatGPT utilizes menu item descriptions to create questions, which are then stored in the database.

  
 *On-Demand Question Generation:* You can send a POST request to the `generate-questions` API to generate questions for multiple menu items. The format for sending data is as follows:
  ```json
  {
    "menu_item_ids": [1, 2, 3]
  }

- Fetching Pre-Generated Questions
  An API endpoint enables users to retrieve pre-generated questions from the database for a given menu item. This feature is particularly useful when questions have already been generated and stored.

- Generating Questions from Text
  Users can input any text, and the API will generate a relevant question based on that text. This functionality extends the application's use beyond menu item descriptions.

== How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   $ git clone https://github.com/Tiwari-Pranav/Culinary-Query
   $ cd CulinaryQuery

2. Set up your environment:
   Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt:
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure OpenAI API Key:
   Set your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file.

4. Run the Django application:
   $ python manage.py runserver

5. Access the API endpoints and explore the functionality.

== Benefits and Outcomes

- Efficient Question Generation: Integrating ChatGPT streamlines question generation, enhancing the user experience and ensuring high-quality questions.
- Automation with Cron Jobs: Scheduled question generation keeps the database updated and relevant without manual intervention.
- Flexible API Endpoints: The APIs cater to various needs, providing dynamic content generation and retrieval.
- Database Storage: All questions are stored in the database, allowing easy management and retrieval.
- Enhanced User Engagement: On-demand question generation improves user engagement and dynamic content.

== Conclusion

The CulinaryQuery project combines the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT with Django's capabilities to create a robust system for automated question generation, storage, and retrieval. By offering versatile API endpoints, this integration provides relevant and engaging content for users, enhancing the application's utility and user experience.

CulinaryQuery is a step toward creating an intelligent and interactive platform for exploring menu items through thoughtful questions and engaging interactions.
